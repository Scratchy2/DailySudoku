# DailySudoku Changelog
## DailySudoku v1
**Initial release. Does not tell you if a number is incorrect, you cannot change a cell's number if it's filled in, and the scoring system is terrible.**

## DailySudoku v2
**New way of rating the difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle, the ability to select a custom difficulty, skill points integration, and optional music.**

## DAILYSUDOKU V3
**A different font for the cells, and FINALLY NOTES! The notes use the 8514oem font, so you may have to install it and change line 49 to match the name of your installation of 8514oem.**
