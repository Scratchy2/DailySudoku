**Each row, column, and block must have the numbers 1 to 9 once. Click "Custom Difficulty" to choose a difficulty to play, or click "Daily Challenge" to do the daily challenge. Stars measure how hard a puzzle is (0 to 6), and the more stars, the harder the puzzle. If you do not wish to be rated, put any number in the "Enter skill points" text box.**
